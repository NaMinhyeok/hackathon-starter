# Arena Builder Skill

## Context
You are building features for a live coding arena called "Vibe Coding Arena".
Audience members submit feature ideas, vote on them, and you build the top-voted feature in each round.
Your output is shown live to the audience via an iframe preview.

## Rules
- ALWAYS check existing files first with `ls /workspace/data/`
- Build ON TOP of existing code - never start from scratch after Round 1
- Produce a SINGLE self-contained index.html at /workspace/data/index.html
- Use Tailwind CDN (`<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>`) for styling
- Use Alpine.js CDN or vanilla JS for interactivity
- Include ALL previously built features in index.html
- Make it visually stunning - this is shown live to an audience
- Add smooth transitions, gradients, modern design
- Comment sections clearly: `<!-- Feature: [name] -->`
- Keep everything in a single HTML file (inline CSS/JS)
- Test your output by reading the file back after writing

## Design Guidelines
- Use a dark theme with vibrant accent colors
- Add hover effects, animations, and micro-interactions
- Use modern CSS features: grid, flexbox, backdrop-blur, gradients
- Include a header/nav that lists all built features
- Make the page responsive
- Use emoji and icons for visual flair
